A. Tidy Data Variables

Tidy data contains 180 rows and 69 columns. Each row has averaged variables for each subject and each activity.

B. Only those variables were kept in the tidy data set for which mean and standard deviation were estimated. 

C. The column 'Subject' is numbered sequentially from 1 to 30 which reflects 30 people participated in all activities.

D. Next the activity column has 6 types: 

1. WALKING
2. WALKING_UPSTAIRS
3. WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS
4. SITTING
5. STANDING
6. LAYING

E. The data set contains 6 rows each for the 30 people subjects and 69 columns (66 of them are variables and the 3 are activity labels,activity and subject). Following is the list:
